# UoA ACM Student Chapter - Open Source Introductory Talk - November 2019

This is an introductory talk for the UoA ACM Student Chapter Open Source action.
This action's purpose is to help promote open source to university students and help
them get involved in it. In this introductory talk, I tried to describe
the basic characteristics, ideas and procedures of open source software development.

The slides are available in this same repository.

## Join the action

This action will communicate through a slack channel, part of the general UoA ACM Student
